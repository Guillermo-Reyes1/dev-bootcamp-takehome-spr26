                    Hey! I'm Guillermo Reyes, but all my friends call me Guille. I'm a First-Year Computer Science 
                    student from El Salvador. I was first intrigued by coding when I stumbled across some YouTube 
                    videos at the age of 15, I've been passionately learning since. I enjoy listening to music, DJing, 
                    and outdoor sports. Throughout my life, I've always found great joy in making other happy; hence, 
                    I would love to be a part of Bits of Good, as I aim to put my talent, work and energy to the service of others.

                                <p>I participated in a voluntary mission year, where I was able to connect with kids 
                                    from lower income households and be like a "brother figure" to them, offering advice
                                    and being present for them emotionally over the course of a year.

                                    different areas of need in our community. There I discovered the NGO Techo, which
                                    specializes in aiding families through the construction of affordable emergency housing.
